🧠 GPU Setup & Training Environment

This project was developed and trained on Binghamton University’s GPU infrastructure using a fully isolated, user-level environment. The setup ensures safe GPU usage, reproducibility, and zero impact on system-level configurations or other users.

1. GPU Server Access

Connected to the university GPU server via SSH.

Off-campus access was enabled using the university VPN.

All operations were performed within the user’s home directory.

ssh craft-guest

2. GPU Selection

The server hosts multiple GPUs.

A free GPU was selected and locked only for the active session using an environment variable.

This does not reserve or affect the GPU globally.

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3

3. Isolated Python Environment (No sudo)

System-level installations were not permitted. To ensure dependency isolation and reproducibility, a local Conda environment was used.

. ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda create -n mri_realism python=3.10 -y
conda activate mri_realism


This approach:

Avoids modifying system Python

Prevents dependency conflicts

Is standard practice on shared GPU clusters

4. GPU-Enabled PyTorch Installation

PyTorch with CUDA support was installed inside the Conda environment only.
The official CUDA 12.1 pip wheels were used to avoid runtime library mismatches.

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

5. Environment Verification

The following check confirms that PyTorch can successfully access the GPU:

python -c "
import torch
print('Torch version:', torch.__version__)
print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())
print('GPU:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
"


Successful output confirms:

CUDA is enabled

GPU is detected

Environment is ready for training

6. Project Structure

All code and data are organized under a dedicated project directory:

mri_realism/
├── src/
│   ├── data/        # Dataset loaders
│   ├── models/      # VAE / Diffusion models
│   ├── train/       # Training logic
│   └── utils/       # Utilities (GPU, logging)
├── scripts/         # Entry-point scripts
├── configs/         # Configuration files
├── data/            # GLI MRI dataset
└── runs/            # Training outputs and checkpoints


This structure supports:

Modular development

Reproducibility

Easy scaling to multi-GPU training

7. Dataset Usage (BraTS-GLI)

Full multi-modal MRI volumes were used (not segmentation masks only).

Each patient includes the following modalities:

T1

T1-CE

T2

T2-FLAIR

The current training objective focuses on realistic brain MRI generation, independent of tumor presence.

8. Design Rationale

This setup enables training on large-scale 3D MRI data while:

Preserving GPU server stability

Maintaining isolation between users

Ensuring experiments are reproducible and scalable
