🚀 How to Connect to a GPU Server and Download Large Datasets (Simple Guide)

This guide explains how I connect to a university GPU server and download large datasets safely.
No advanced Linux knowledge needed.

🧠 Big Picture (ELI5 version)

Think of the GPU server like a very powerful computer in another building.

What we do:

Connect to that computer

Create our own workspace

Download big datasets directly on the server (much faster)

Organize everything neatly

1️⃣ Connect to the GPU Server
Step 1: Connect to VPN

Open the Cisco VPN desktop app

Connect to the university VPN
(This makes your laptop “inside” the campus network)

Step 2: Open terminal on your laptop

Windows → Command Prompt or PowerShell

Step 3: Connect to GPU machine
ssh <GPU_USERNAME>@<GPU_SERVER_ADDRESS>


✅ After login, you will see something like:

username@server-name:~$


This means you are now inside the GPU server.

2️⃣ Create Your Personal Workspace

We never work in shared folders.

mkdir -p ~/my_workspace
cd ~/my_workspace


Create clean subfolders:

mkdir data projects runs logs


📁 Folder meaning (simple):

data/ → datasets

projects/ → code

runs/ → model outputs

logs/ → training logs

3️⃣ Check GPU Availability

Before using GPUs, always check:

nvidia-smi


This shows:

How many GPUs exist

Which ones are busy

How much memory is free

4️⃣ Why We Download Data on the Server (Important)

❌ Uploading from laptop → slow, breaks often
✅ Downloading on server → fast, stable

So we always download large datasets directly on the server.

5️⃣ Download Datasets from Synapse (Simple & Safe)
Step 1: Go to dataset folder
cd ~/my_workspace/data/<DATASET_NAME>


Example:

cd ~/my_workspace/data/GLI

Step 2: Set access token (hidden)
export SYN_TOKEN="YOUR_SYNapse_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"


🔐 Token is:

Stored only in memory

Removed later

Never committed to Git

Step 3: Download files (one by one)
synapse -p "$SYN_TOKEN" get <synID>.1 --downloadLocation .


Example:

synapse -p "$SYN_TOKEN" get syn12345678.1 --downloadLocation .


Repeat for each file.

Step 4: Verify download
ls -lh


You should see:

File name

File size (GBs for large datasets)

Step 5: Remove token from memory (important)
unset SYN_TOKEN

6️⃣ Repeat for Other Datasets

Same steps for:

GLI

MEN

MET

PED

SSA

Only change:

cd ~/my_workspace/data/<FOLDER_NAME>


Everything else stays the same.

7️⃣ Final Sanity Check (All Data)
du -sh ~/my_workspace/data/*


This confirms:

Which datasets exist

Rough sizes

Nothing missing

🧸 Ultra-Simple Summary (Child Version)

Turn on VPN

Open terminal

Connect to big computer

Make your own folders

Download files directly on big computer

Check files are there

Start working 🚀

✅ Why This Approach Is Good

Fast downloads
No broken uploads
Clean structure
Safe credentials
Easy to reproduce

📦 Unzipping the GLI Dataset (Simple Steps)

After downloading the GLI dataset, the files come as ZIP files.
We need to open (unzip) them so we can use the data for training.

🧠 What is unzipping? (ELI5)

A ZIP file is like a closed box.
Unzipping means opening the box and taking the files out.

1️⃣ Go to the GLI folder on the server
cd ~/sjaipurkar/data/GLI


Check what is inside:

ls -lh


You should see:

ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-TrainingData.zip
ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-ValidationData.zip

2️⃣ Create folders for extracted data

This keeps things neat and organized.

mkdir -p training validation

3️⃣ Unzip the training dataset
unzip ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-TrainingData.zip -d training


⏳ This may take some time because the file is large.

4️⃣ Unzip the validation dataset
unzip ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-ValidationData.zip -d validation

5️⃣ Check that unzipping worked
ls -lh


Then check inside training:

ls training


You should see a folder like:

ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-TrainingData

6️⃣ Check one sample (optional sanity check)
cd training/ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-TrainingData
ls | head


Each folder represents one patient, and inside are MRI files (.nii.gz).

7️⃣ (Optional) Delete ZIP files to save space

⚠️ Only do this after confirming unzipping worked.

rm ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-TrainingData.zip
rm ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-ValidationData.zip

✅ Final Folder Structure
GLI/
 ├── training/
 │    └── ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-TrainingData/
 │         └── BraTS-GLI-XXXXX/
 ├── validation/
 │    └── ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-ValidationData/

🧸 One-line Summary

Download ZIP → create folders → unzip → check files → start training 🚀
