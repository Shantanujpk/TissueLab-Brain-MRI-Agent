[1) Your Dataset]
   (ID, Text Description, Real MRI .nii)
          |
          |  Why: we need paired examples so the model learns what MRI
          |       usually looks like when the text says certain findings
          v
[2) Preprocess MRI Volumes]
   - resample to same spacing
   - crop/pad to fixed size (ex: 128×128×128)
   - normalize intensity
          |
          |  Why: MRI files are all different shapes/scale;
          |       models hate messy inputs. Same size = stable training.
          v
[3) Train a 3D VAE / Autoencoder (MRI ↔ Latent)]
   MRI  ---> Encoder --->  Latent (small "zip" version)
   MRI  <--- Decoder <---  Latent
          |
          |  Why: generating full 3D MRI directly is too hard.
          |       We first learn a "compress + reconstruct" engine.
          |       If reconstructions look real, decoder is good.
          v
[4) Cache Latents for All MRIs]
   For every training MRI:
   latent = Encoder(MRI)
   save latent to disk
          |
          |  Why: speeds up training a lot.
          |       Diffusion will train on small latents instead of big MRIs.
          v
[5) Process Text (Text → Embedding)]
   Text ---> Medical Text Encoder (BioBERT etc.) ---> text embedding
          |
          |  Why: model can’t use raw words;
          |       embedding turns text into numbers with meaning.
          v
[6) (Optional but Powerful) Extract Structured Facts from Text]
   From text pull:
   - location (left frontal)
   - enhancement (ring)
   - edema (extensive)
   - size (76×72×69)
   - midline shift (right)
   -> structured vector
          |
          |  Why: makes the model obey details better and reduces randomness.
          v
[7) Train Text-Conditioned Latent Diffusion]
   Inputs: (noisy latent, text embedding, structured vector)
   Output: predicted noise (denoise step)
          |
          |  Why: diffusion learns to start from noise and "paint"
          |       a realistic latent that matches the text.
          v
[8) Generate MRI from New Text (Inference)]
   New Text -> embeddings
   Start with random latent noise
   Diffusion denoises step-by-step -> final latent
   final latent -> VAE Decoder -> Generated MRI volume
          |
          |  Why: this is your final “text → MRI” generator.
          v
[9) Make it Human-Friendly (Visualization Output)]
   Generated MRI volume ->
   - save .nii (optional)
   - export PNG slice grid (axial slices)
   - (optional) colored disease overlay
          |
          |  Why: humans understand slices/images, not raw 3D arrays.
